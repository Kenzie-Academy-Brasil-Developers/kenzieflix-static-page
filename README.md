# Netflix Clone Static Page Project



This is a project aimed at recreating the Netflix homepage in a static format using HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript. The primary goal is to practice web design and front-end development skills by replicating the look and feel of the famous streaming platform.

## Features and Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The core structure of the page is built with HTML5, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.

- **CSS3**: Styling is done using CSS3 to achieve a visual appearance closely resembling Netflix.

- **JavaScript (Optional)**: If needed, JavaScript can be implemented to add interactive features.

## Functionality

- **Faithful Recreation**: The page is designed to closely resemble the Netflix interface, including the top navigation, movie carousels, and featured images.

- **Responsiveness**: The page is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.

- **Possible API Integration**: In the future, consideration may be given to integrating with the Netflix API to fetch real movie and series data.
